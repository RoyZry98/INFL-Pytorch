# Implicit Neural Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserved Biological Analysis ✨🧬🔐

Code and data to reproduce the **INFL** on three **Cancer Subtyping**, **Cell Perturbation**, and **Multi-Omics Integration** benchmarking results in our manuscript.

## Overview 📚
INFL is a lightweight federated learning framework based on Implicit Neural Representations that addresses heterogeneity, privacy, and scalability in biomedical data integration. By embedding a secret key into its architecture and using coordinate-conditioned modules, INFL ensures strong privacy and seamless aggregation across diverse client models. It demonstrates broad applicability across biomedical omics tasks, including classification in bulk proteomics, regression in single-cell transcriptomics, and clustering in spatial and multi-omics data, while preserving performance for downstream scientific and clinical applications.

- Privacy-preserving: 🔒 Federated + implicit representation with secret key
- Heterogeneity-robust: 🌐 Handles modality/site variation
- Scalable: ⚡ Lightweight model aggregation
- Bio tasks: 🧪 Proteomics (classification), 🧫 scRNA-seq (regression), 🧭 spatial/multi-omics (clustering)
